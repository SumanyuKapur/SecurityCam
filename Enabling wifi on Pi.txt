From the console (PuTTY window), edit the network properties of the Raspberry:

	sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces 

Now add these lines at the end of the file (or change existing lines to match these):

	allow-hotplug wlan0 
	iface wlan0 inet dhcp 
	wpa-ssid "YOUR NETWORK SSID"
	wpa-psk "WIFI PASSWORD"

(Fill in the SSID and password for your WiFi network)
Reboot the Raspberry with this command and see if it correctly connects to your WiFi network:

	sudo reboot
