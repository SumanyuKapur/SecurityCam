Now you can access the live stream from the camera from any browser via the url 

	http://IPADDRESSOFRASPBERRY:8080

Where 8080 is the port that we've configured for our stream in the motion.conf file. See your own configuration setting "stream_port" in motion.conf for the port.
Google Chrome 30 (not even on iOS) wasn't able to play this stream directly due to a bug in the underlying Chromium project.
A workaround for this is to create a simple html file that contains one large image with the stream-url of the camera. See the file cam.html from raspberry_surveillance_cam_scavix.zip. This way, Chrome can show the live stream as well. Let's hope that Chrome will fix this issue in their browser.
But other browsers like FireFox, Safari and even VLC media player was able to show the live stream of the camera.
Live stream doesn't work in Internet Explorer as it doesn't support Motion JPEG.
And it also works on your Mobile Device
